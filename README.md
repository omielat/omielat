- 👋 Hi, I’m @omielat, better known as Tonye!
- 👀 I’m interested in music, tech, spirituality and a lot of things I really have no understanding of. I'm really just interested in anything that I can connect to.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about myself. As a producer, I'm prioritizing just having fun and knowing less is more. I'm also learning more about coding and how I can bridge the gap between my music and the more expansive creative ideas I have.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects requiring licensed music and UX design projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: by email or through social media. Email: tnye@prdrck.com | IG: tonye.ayeba | Twitter: TonyeAyeba
